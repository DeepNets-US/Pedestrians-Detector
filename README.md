# Pedestrian Detector

## Overview

Welcome to the Pedestrian Detector project â€“ an intelligent AI application designed to detect pedestrians in images. This project is equipped with a state-of-the-art deep learning model and features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for effortless use.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Pedestrian Detector, follow these steps:

1. Download the model weights file from the provided link: [Download Weights File](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights).
2. Place the downloaded weights file in the project directory.

## Running the Pedestrian Detector

### Option 1: GUI via Command Line

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Go to [gui.py](https://github.com/DeepNets-US/Pedestrians-Detector/blob/main/gui.py)
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual GUI Run

1. Open your preferred Python environment or IDE.
2. Open the [`gui.py`](https://github.com/DeepNets-US/Pedestrians-Detector/blob/main/gui.py) file.
3. Run the script.

## Note

Make sure to download the weights file and place it in the project directory before running the GUI. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and other Python files in the repository for additional insights into the pedestrian detection capabilities.
